@par Example Description 

The BSP examples detects the presence of Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield with joystick and uSD.

If the Adafruit shield is NOT connected, then:
 - Red led (led3) blinks waiting the user button is pushed.
 - Then red led switches off and green & blue LEDs start blinking at high frequency.
 - Pushing user button again and again blinking frequency decreases until looping 
   to high frequency.

If the Adafruit shield is connected, then this example shows how to use the different 
functionalities of LCD, SD card and joystick by switching between tests using key button.
  - Red led (led3) blinks waiting the user button is pushed. 
  - Firstly, use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
    (up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).
  - Secondly, this example shows how to use the different LCD features to display 
    string with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.
  - Thirdly, this example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card.
At the end of the nine examples when pushing the user button the application loops 
to the beginning (first examples).

@par Hardware and Software environment

 - This Demo runs on STM32F413Zx devices 
  
 - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F413ZH (MB1137) 
   and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

 - NUCLEO-F413ZH Set-up
   - Connect the Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield (https://www.adafruit.com/products/802)
   - Make sure that the SB165, SB121 are closed and the SB174, SB146, SB122 are opened on the NUCLEO-F413ZH board (bottom side) 
   
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open your preferred toolchain 
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
