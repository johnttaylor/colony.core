@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC in Polling mode to convert data through the HAL API.

When the end of conversion occurs, the converted data of ADC1 DR register is 
affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

Note that the test carries out only one conversion. To trigger another conversion, the user
needs to reset then restart the example execution. 


Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to pin PC0 (Arduino connector CN9 pin 3).
This allows to modify ADC_CHANNEL_10 voltage.

The converted value is monitored through debugger: uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

STM32 board LED can be used to monitor the conversion:
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error occurs.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F413xx/STM32F423xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F413ZH-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
