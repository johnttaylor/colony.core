@par Example Description 

This example shows how to re-route the C library printf function to the UART.
The UART outputs a message on the HyperTerminal.

Board: STM32F413ZH-Nucleo
Tx Pin: PD.08
Rx Pin: PD.09

LED3 is ON when there is an error occurrence.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F413xx/STM32F423xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F413ZH-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - STM32F413ZH-Nucleo Set-up
    Connect ST-Link cable to the PC USB port to display data on the HyperTerminal. 
    A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal.
    
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - Flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
