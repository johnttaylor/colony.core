# Outcast 

Outcast is for the lack of better term - a software development paradigm- that encompasses SCM and build 
processes, requirements trace-ability, design methodologies, unit testing, programming languages, and 
documentation. All this was a result of trying to solve the problem of how to manage, in a team environment, 
a scalable reusable code base.  See www.integerfox.com/outcast for more details
