@par Example Description

How to configure the EXTI and use GPIOs to toggle the user LEDs 
available on the board when a user button is pressed. It is based on the
STM32F7xx LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI_Line15_10) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.

In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - EXTI_Line15_10 is connected to PC.13 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on EXTI_Line15_10 by pressing User push-button, LED1 toggles

On NUCLEO-F767ZI:
    - EXTI_Line15_10 is connected to User push-button

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
