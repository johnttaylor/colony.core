@par Example Description

Use of a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update the PWM duty cycle. This example is based on the 
STM32F7xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK) frequency is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 2 and it is twice PCLK1.
    TIM3CLK = 2*PCLK1
    PCLK1 = HCLK/2
    => TIM3CLK = (2/2)*HCLK = SystemCoreClock (216 Mhz)

To set the TIM3 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F7xx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR3) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:
Duty cycle = (CCR3 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel is mapped on the pin PB.0 (connected to LED1 on board
NUCLEO-F767ZI). Thus LED1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output
level (active v.s. inactive).

User push-button can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.
@note The LED1 is not toggling. In fact, if the dutycycle is 0% so the LED1 is OFF. When pushing 
successively the user button, the LED1 is ON and its luminosity rises as the dutycycle value keep 
increasing.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
