@par Example Description

How to configure and use the CRC calculation unit to compute an 8-bit CRC code
for a given data buffer, based on a user-defined generating polynomial. The
peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions for
optimization purposes (performance and size).

CRC Peripheral is configured to work with a user defined polynomial value (8-bit long value).
In this example, the polynomial is set manually to 0x9B that is X^8 + X^7 + X^4 + X^3 + X + 1.
Generated CRC value is then 8-bit long.

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, CRC configuration is performed (use of user-defined Polynomial value).
CRC code of a given data buffer is computed. 
Data buffer length has been chosen as not an exact nb of u32 (32-bit words), in order to illustrate 
use of offered API for feeding the calculator (u32, u16 or u8 inputs).
The calculated CRC code is stored in ubCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, CRC value (ubCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value (ubExpectedCRCValue),
and if both are equal, LED1 is turned On. 
In case of errors, LED1 is blinking (1sec period).

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
