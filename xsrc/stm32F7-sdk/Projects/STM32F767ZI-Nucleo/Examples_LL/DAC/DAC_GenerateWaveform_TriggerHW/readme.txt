@par Example Description

How to use the DAC peripheral to generate a voltage waveform from a digital data
stream transfered by DMA. This example is based on the STM32F7xx
$moduleName$ LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
One DAC channel (DAC1 channel1) is configured to connect DAC channel output on GPIO pin
to get the samples from DMA transfer and to get conversion trigger from timer.

Other peripherals configured in this example:
one DMA channel and one timer are configured to provide samples to be generated
by DAC peripheral:
sinus waveform, frequency 1kHz, amplitude Vdda.
(these settings are configurable by changing literals values in file header).

Example execution:
From the main program execution, LED1 is toggling quickly while waiting for
user button press.
DMA and timer are configured and activated to transfer data and trig DAC conversion.
Then, the DAC is configured and activated: waveform is generated on DAC output
indefinitely.
DAC channel output value is provided by DMA transfer, a new value is loaded
at each trigger from trimer.
Finally, LED1 is turned-on.

Connection needed:
None. 
Oscilloscope for monitoring DAC channel output (cf pin below).
Other peripheral used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA.04 (Board Nucleo144: morpho connector CN11 pin 32 (in front of Arduino connector CN9 pin A2), Zio connector CN7 pin 17)
  For waveform voltage generation: 1 DMA channel, 1 timer.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
