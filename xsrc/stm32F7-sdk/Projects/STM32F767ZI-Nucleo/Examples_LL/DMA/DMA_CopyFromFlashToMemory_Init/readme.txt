@par Example Description

This example describes how to use a DMA to transfer a word data buffer
from Flash memory to embedded SRAM. Peripheral initialization done
using LL initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.

Then the LED_Init() function is used to initialize the LED1.

Then the Configure_DMA() function is used to configure the DMA2_Stream0 to transfer the contents of a 32-word data
buffer stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software(LL_DMA_EnableStream()). DMA2_Stream0 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the channel enable bit for DMA2_Stream0.
At the end of the transfer a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled and the callback function (customized by user) is called.

Finally, aSRC_Const_Buffer and aDST_Buffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

NUCLEO-F767ZI's LED1 can be used to monitor the transfer status:
- LED1 is turned ON if the DMA data transfer is successfully completed.
- LED1 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
