@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API
how to swap execution between bank1 and bank2 of the STM32F7xx internal FLASH memory mounted on STM32F767ZI-Nucleo.
  
At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 216 MHz. 

Below are the steps to run this example:
1- Choose the FLASH_SwapBank_Bank2 project and generate its binary (ie: FLASH_SwapBank.bin)

2- Configure the FLASH memory at Dual Bank mode using STM32 ST-LINK Utilities (Target -> Options Bytes: 
   "nDBANK" should be unchecked, "nDBOOT" should be checked).
   Then, Load FLASH_SwapBank.bin binary at the bank2 of the flash (at the address 0x08100000) using STM32 
   ST-LINK Utilities(www.st.com) or any similar tool.   

@note:
 - You can avoid step 1 by directly loading the binary file provided with the example
 - You have to configure your preferred toolchain in order to generate the binary
   file after compiling the project.
   
3- Choose the FLASH_SwapBank_Bank1 project and run it, this project will be loaded
   in the bank1 of the flash: at the address 0x08000000
   
4- Click the BUTTON_USER button to swap between the two banks,

- If program is executing from bank1 is selected, LED1 toggles,

- If program is executing from bank2 is selected, LED2 toggles,

- If error occurs, LED3 is turn on.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767ZI devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F767ZI-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
