@par Example Description 

This example describes how to reload the IWDG counter and to simulate a software 
fault by generating an MCU IWDG reset when a programmed time period has elapsed.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.

The IWDG timeout is set to 250 ms (the timeout may vary due to LSI frequency 
dispersion).

First, the TIM5 timer is configured to measure the LSI frequency as the 
LSI is internally connected to TIM5 CH4, in order to adjust the IWDG clock.

The LSI measurement using the TIM5 is described below:
  - Configure the TIM5 to remap internally the TIM5 CH4 Input Capture to the LSI
    clock output.
  - Enable the TIM5 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
    period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
    its real value. 

Then, the IWDG reload counter is configured as below to obtain 250 ms according 
to the measured LSI frequency after setting the prescaler value:
  
    IWDG counter clock Frequency = LSI Frequency / Prescaler value

The IWDG reload counter is refreshed each 240 ms in the main program infinite 
loop to prevent a IWDG reset.
  
LED2 is also toggled each 240 ms indicating that the program is running.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the rising edge of the signal.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the User push-button (PC.13), the corresponding interrupt  
is served.

In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception 
containing an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the IWDG 
reload counter is not refreshed).
As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG reset occurs.
  
If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 is turned ON.
If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed in the main 
program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

LED3 is turned ON and remains ON if any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
