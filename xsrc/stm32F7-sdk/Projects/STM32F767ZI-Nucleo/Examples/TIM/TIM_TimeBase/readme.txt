@par Example Description 

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate a timebase of 
one second with the corresponding interrupt request.

    In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK)  is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1) x2,
    since APB1 prescaler is equal to 4.
      TIM3CLK = PCLK1*2
      PCLK1 = HCLK/4
      => TIM3CLK = HCLK/2 = SystemCoreClock/2
    To get TIM3 counter clock at 10 KHz, the Prescaler is computed as follows:
    Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
    Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock/2) /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F7xx Devices.

The TIM3 ARR register value is equal to 10000 - 1, 
Update rate = TIM3 counter clock / (Period + 1) = 1 Hz,
So the TIM3 generates an interrupt each 1 s

When the counter value reaches the auto-reload register value, the TIM update 
interrupt is generated and, in the handler routine, pin PB.0 (connected to LED1 on board STM32F767ZI-Nucleo)
is toggled at the following frequency: 0.5Hz.

In case of error, LED3 is turned ON.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767ZI devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 216 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F767ZI-Nucleo
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32F767ZI-Nucleo Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected to PB.0 pin (pin 31 in CN10 connector) and connect it on an oscilloscope 
      to show the Time Base signal.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
