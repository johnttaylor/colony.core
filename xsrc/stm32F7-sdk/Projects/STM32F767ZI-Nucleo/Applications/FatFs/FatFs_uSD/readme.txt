@par Application Description

This application provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module, in order to develop an
application exploiting FatFs offered features with microSD drive configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 100 MHz.
The SD module is part of the Adafruit shield.

The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps:

 - Link the uSD disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the uSD drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Unlink the uSD disk I/O driver.

Notice that the application manages possible errors that might occur during the
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. In addition, user can check if the
written text file is available on the uSD card.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements.

NUCLEO-F767ZI board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 (Green) is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3  (Red)  is ON when any error occurs.

@note LED1 is turned ON, because it's sharing the same pin with the SPI CLK signal used to communicate with the Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about FatFs implementation on STM32Cube, please refer to UM1721 "Developing Applications
on STM32Cube with FatFs".

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F767ZI devices.

  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F767ZI boards
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the NUCLEO-F767ZI Adafruit uSD slot
    - Connect the NUCLEO-F767ZI board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male
      to A-Male' cable to the connector:

  - Make sure that the jumper JP4 is closed

  - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN7, CN8, CN9 and CN10 Arduino connectors,
    for more details please refer to User Manual.
