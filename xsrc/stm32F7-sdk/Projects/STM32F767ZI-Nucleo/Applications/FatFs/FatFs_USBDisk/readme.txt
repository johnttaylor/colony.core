@par Application Description

How to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs middleware component as a generic FAT
file system module and STM32 USB On-The-Go (OTG) host library, in both Full
Speed (FS) and High Speed (HS) modes. This example develops an application
exploiting FatFs features, with USB disk drive configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. 
The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config() function to configure the system 
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 100 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses internally 
a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the PLL I2S.
           
The application is based on writing a text file to a drive, and it's performed 
using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described in the following steps: 

 - Link the USB Host disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the USB drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Unlink the USB Host disk I/O driver.
 
Notice that the application manages possible errors that might occur during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. In addition, user can check if the
written text file is available on the USB disk.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 

NUCLEO-F767ZI board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs. 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F767ZI devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F767ZI boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI board Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the NUCLEO-F767ZI board through 'USB micro A-Male 
            to A-Female' cable(CN13).

    - Make sure that the jumper JP4 is closed
