#Catch is a header based C++ Unit test framework
Catch is a header based C++ Unit test framework.
Unittests are an integral part of Outcast (see www.integerfox.com/outcast) and the Catch framework is used in many of the Outcast packages.

# catch v1.x
A 'released' version of the github project www.github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/Catch1.x

# catch v2.x
A 'released' version of the github project www.github.com/catchorg/Catch2.  

# Why a copy
Why a 'copy'?  I need an Outcast'ized package of the Catch source code - so this repository is for that purpose (the Outcast tools are currently not sophisticated enough to pull directly from the github project).  If you are interested in Catch, please proceed to its project www.github.com/catchorg
