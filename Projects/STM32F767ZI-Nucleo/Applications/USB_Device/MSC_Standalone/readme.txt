@par application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC).

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F7xx USB Device peripheral to communicate with a PC
Host using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent commands,
while the microSD card is used as storage media. The STM32 MCU is enumerated as a MSC device using the
native PC Host MSC driver to which the NUCLEO-F767ZI board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL.

When the application is started, the user has just to plug the USB cable into a PC host and the device
is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the system window and write/read/format
operations can be performed as with any other removable drive.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the application footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the MSC class structure size.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F767ZI devices.

  - This application has been tested with a NUCLEO-F767ZI board embedding
    a STM32767ZI device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the Adafruit shield uSD slot mounted on NUCLEO-F767ZI board
    - Connect the NUCLEO-F767ZI board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to CN13 connector: 

    - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN7,CN8, CN9 and CN10 Arduino connectors, 
      for more details please refer to board User manual.
