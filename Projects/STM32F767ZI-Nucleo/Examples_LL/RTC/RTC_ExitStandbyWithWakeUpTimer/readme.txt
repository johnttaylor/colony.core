@par Example Description

Configuration of the RTC to wake up from Standby mode 
using the RTC Wakeup timer. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service 
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).
  
In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using 
the PLL with HSE as clock source.

Example execution:
   - 1st execution of the system, LED1 is quickly blinking (every 200ms). 
   - Press the user button:
     * RTC wakup timer is configured to 5 seconds
     * System enters in standby mode (LED1 is switched off)
   - After 5 seconds, system resumes from standby mode, then LED1 is slowly blinking (every 500ms).
   - LED1 is toggling every 1 second: This indicates that the system generates an error.   @note LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.

@note LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSI as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate 
      line on the main.h file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI */
      @endcode
      LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
