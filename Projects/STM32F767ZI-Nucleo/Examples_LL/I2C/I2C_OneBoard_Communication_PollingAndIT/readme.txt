@par Example Description

How to transmit data bytes from an I2C master device using polling mode 
to an I2C slave device using interrupt mode. The peripheral is initialized 
with LL unitary service functions to optimize for performance and size.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO and I2C peripherals using only one NUCLEO-F767ZI.

I2C2 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a write request by Master through Handle_I2C_Master() routine.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C2, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write.
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the bytes.
When acknowledge is received on I2C1, a TXIS event occurs.
This will allow Master to transmit a byte to the Slave.
Each time a byte is received on I2C2 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs until a STOP condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received a TXIS event occurs on Master side.
Master auto-generate a Stop condition when size of data to transmit is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of reception on Slave side.
I2C2 IRQ handler and Handle_I2C_Master() routine are then clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED1 is On if data are well received.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

@Note�If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
 �����then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
������The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
����� It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
������In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
������Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
������Please refer to the AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�
������Please refer to the AN4839 �Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C2 SCL/SDA (PB.10 and PB.11)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C1 (PB.6 and PB.9).
      - I2C2_SCL  PB.10 (CN10, pin 32) : connected to I2C1_SCL PB.6 (CN10, pin 13) 
      - I2C2_SDA  PB.11 (CN10, pin 34) : connected to I2C1_SDA PB.9 (CN7, pin 4)

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button to initiate a write request by Master 
      then Slave receive bytes.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
