@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on a channel, 
at each software start. This example uses the DMA programming model 
(for polling or interrupt programming models, refer to other examples).

This example is based on the STM32F7xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.
Note: In this example, array size can be set to 1 (equivalent to a single variable)
      to have a scenario comparable to other ADC examples using programming model
      polling or interruption.
      Size of array can be modified with literal ADC_CONVERTED_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE).

Example execution:
At each press on push button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected
channel.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array.
When DMA reaches the selected number of transfers,
DMA half transfer and transfer complete interruptions occurs.
Data array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).
LED1 is turned off at DMA half transfer and turned on at DMA transfer complete.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "aADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values (array of data)

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for LED1
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 ( connector CN7 pin 17)
  DMA

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
