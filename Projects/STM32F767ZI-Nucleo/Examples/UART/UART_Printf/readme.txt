@par Example Description 

Re-routing of the C library printf function to the UART.
The UART outputs a message on the HyperTerminal.

Board: STM32F767ZI-Nucleo
Tx Pin: PD.08
Rx Pin: PD.09

LED3 is ON when there is an error occurrence.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note�If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
 �����then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
������The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
����� It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
������In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
������Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
������Please refer to the AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�
������Please refer to the AN4839 �Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767ZI devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F767ZI-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - STM32F767ZI-Nucleo Set-up:
    Connect the NUCLEO-F767ZI board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male to A-Male' cable to display data on the HyperTerminal. 
A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - Flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
