@par Application Description

How to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs middleware component as a generic FAT
file system module. This example develops an application exploiting FatFs
features with a microSD drive configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 100 MHz. 
The SD module is part of the Adafruit shield. 
 
The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps: 

 - Link the uSD disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the uSD drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Unlink the uSD disk I/O driver.

Notice that the application manages possible errors that might occur during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. In addition, user can check if the
written text file is available on the uSD card.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 
 
NUCLEO-F413ZH Rev B boards LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED2 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs. 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F413xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F413ZH boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F413ZH Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the NUCLEO-F413ZH Adafruit uSD slot 

  - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN7, CN8, CN9 and CN10 Arduino connectors, 
    for more details please refer to User Manual.

  - Make sure that the SB165, SB121 are closed and the SB174, SB146, SB122 are opened on the NUCLEO-F413ZH board (bottom side) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
