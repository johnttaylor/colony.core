@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to generate a single pulse when
a rising edge of an external signal is received on the timer Input pin.

Clock setup for TIM3
================================

  TIM3CLK = SystemCoreClock = 100 MHz.
  
  Prescaler = (TIM3CLK /TIM3 counter clock) - 1
  
  The prescaler value is computed in order to have TIM3 counter clock 
  set at 25000000 Hz.
  
  The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM3->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
  trigger the TIM3 input is 25000000/65535 [Hz].
 
Configuration of TIM3 in One Pulse Mode
===================================================
 
  - The external signal is connected to TIM3_CH2 pin (PB.05), 
    and a rising edge on this input is used to trigger the Timer.
  - The One Pulse signal is output on TIM3_CH1 (PB.04).

  The delay value is fixed to:
   - Delay =  CCR1/TIM3 counter clock 
           = 16383 / 25000000 [sec]
           
  The pulse value is fixed to : 
   - Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM3 counter clock  
                 = (65535 - 16383) / 25000000 [sec]

  The one pulse waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope and it looks
  like this.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32F413xx/STM32F423xx devices.
   - In this example, the clock is set to 100 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F413ZH-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F413ZH-Nucleo Set-up
   - Connect the external signal to the TIM3_CH2 pin (PB.05) (CN7, pin 13)
   - Connect the TIM3_CH1 pin(PB.04) (CN7, pin 19) to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
