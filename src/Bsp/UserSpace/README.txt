This 'Bsp' namespace contains a 'Null' BSP for applications that run on
a desktop OS in user space.  The intent of this 'Null' BSP is to support being
able to compile code - for desktop OS target - that has dependencies on a BSP. 
The 'Null' BSP is strictly for verifing compiler indepedency and very limited
unittesting in desktop target environment.
