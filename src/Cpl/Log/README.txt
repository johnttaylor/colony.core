<pre>    

The 'Cpl::Log' namespace provides interfaces for logging Application 
events and/or information at run time.  The Application can create and
use many different 'logger types' based on it needs.  

NOTE: This namespace is NOT intended to be a debug and/or printf-tracing 
      interface (see Cpl::System::Trace for such an interface).
