The 'Cmd' namespace contains the implemenation of DAC Shell commands. The
application is free to choose which commands to include in its DAC Shell.

Note: Each command (the .cpp files) is stored in seperated sub-directories.
      This is done so when using a build environment (e.g. NQBP) that builds
      by-directory - the application does not have build commands it does
      not use.
