# freertos
This repository contains an 'Outcast distribution' of released version(s) of the FreeRTOS kernel.  FreeRTOS is an open source Cross Platform Real Time Operating System (RTOS).  This is **NOT** the FreeRTOS site and/or github repository!  If you are interested in FreeRTOS please go directly to http://www.freertos.org. 

Why a 'copy' of FreeRTOS? I need an Outcast'ized package of the FreeRTOS source code - so this repository is for that purpose (the Outcast tools are currently not sophisticated enough to pull directly from FreeRTOS's website/repositories. 

The FreeRTOS source code is licensed by a *modified* GNU General Public License (GPL).  The modification is provided in the form of an exception.  See the 'license.txt' file for license details.
